This is a (mostly) functional chess game that operates from the command line!
The missing rule in this current implementation is en passant.

Input moves as "Square1 [space] Square2".
If an invalid move is specified, it will request another.


Further optimizations can be made, however this barebones implementation
has passed some extensive testing.

This was ran and tested inside of the Intellij IDE.

Language is Java.
