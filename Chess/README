This is a (mostly) functional chess game that operates from the command line!
The missing rule in this current implementation is en passant.

Input moves as "Square1 [space] Square2".
If an invalid move is specified, it will say so, and you may input another.

Fairly extensively tested.

This was ran and tested inside of the Intellij IDE.

Language is Java.

A GUI later to come.

TODO: Clean up Repo to only use the production folder, as that is where all the code is and is therefore what is relevant.
